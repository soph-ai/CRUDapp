# First Project: CRUD app- Mr Meeseeks Box 

Mr Meeseeks' are creatures created to serve a singular purpose. Once they have served this purpose they expire/vanish. 

You can summon a Mr Meeseeks by activating a Mr Meeseeks box. This allows you to name him and assign him a task you want him to complete, recording also the date that the task was assigned. Mark the task as completed once Mr Meeseeks has fulfilled his purpose and he will then disappear/expire. 

Although dedicated to the task initially assigned to him, Mr Meeseeks can be persuaded to shift his purpose- you can then ask him to complete a different task of your choosing. 

This app allows for full CRUD functionality, allowing you to create Mr Meeseeks, update his task/purpose, delete him when expired and view all the tasks you have assigned to Mr Meeseeks'.
